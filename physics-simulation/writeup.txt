In this project, my workflow is as follow:
1. Write force function and calculate the acceleration, test with gravity.
2. write sphere/sphere collision, sphere/plane collision and sphere/triangle collision test.
3. write torque function, and test with rotation scene.
4. write spring function
5. integrate rk4 in the integrator, and replace the old step funtion.

I wrote a RK4Object class for storing RK4 data for position, rotation and velocity. Also on the sphere/triangle
test part, I used old raytracing method to detect that.
